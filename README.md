## Documentation


## Installation
<!--
You can install the release version from CRAN

``` r
install.packages("idDMR", dependencies=TRUE)
```

and the development version from GitHub
-->
``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DanielAlhassan/idDMR") 
```

## Usage
To use the **idDMR** package, start by loading dependencies which will install (where necessary) and load all dependent packages:

```r
library(idDMR)

load_dependencies()
```

To run site-level test, use the function **cpgsite.annotate()**
```r
myannotation <- cpgsite.annotate(datatype = "array",new_mval,what = "M",arraytype = "450K",
                                 analysis.type = "differential",design = design_mat,
                                 coef = 2, fdr = 0.05)
```

To 
```r
aadmr = aaDMR(myannotation,h = 1000,  min.cpgs = 2)
aadmr_df <- arrange(data.frame(extractRanges(aadmr, genome = "hg19")),seqnames)

```
