## Documentation


## Installation
<!--
You can install the release version from CRAN

``` r
install.packages("idDMR", dependencies=TRUE)
```

and the development version from GitHub
-->
``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DanielAlhassan/idDMR") 
```

## Usage
To use the **idDMR** package, start by loading dependencies which will install (where necessary) and load all dependent packages:

```r
library(idDMR)

load_dependencies()
```

To run CpG site-level test (or determine differentially methylated loci), use the function `cpgsite.annotate()`
```r
myannotation <- cpgsite.annotate(datatype = "array", mval, what = "M",arraytype = "450K",
                                 analysis.type = "differential",design = design_mat,
                                 coef = 2, fdr = 0.05)
```

Next, use `aadmr()` function to identify differentially methylated regions. 
```r
aadmr = aaDMR(myannotation, h = 1000,  min.cpgs = 2)

#extract the DMResults and output as a dataframe
aadmr_df <- arrange(data.frame(extractRanges(aadmr, genome = "hg19")),seqnames)

```

## Acknowledgments
We would like to immensely thank all authors and contributors to the DMRcate R/Biconductor package - their work served as a major foundation for this package we made.
